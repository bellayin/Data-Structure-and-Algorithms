**Task** 

A prime is a natural number greater than `1` that has no positive divisors other than `1` and itself. Given a number, `n`, determine and print whether it's `Prime` or `Not prime`.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, `T`, the number of test cases. 
Each of the `T` subsequent lines contains an integer, `n`, to be tested for primality.

**Output Format**

For each test case, print whether `n` is `Prime` or `Not prime` on a new line.

**Sample Input**

3<br>
12<br>
5<br>
7<br>

**Sample Output**

Not prime<br>
Prime<br>
Prime<br>

Explanation

Test Case 0: `n=12`. 
`12` is divisible by numbers other than `1` and itself (i.e.: 2, 3, 6), so we print `No prime` on a new line.

Test Case 1: `n=5`. 
`5` is only divisible to `1` and itself, so we print `Prime` on a new line.

Test Case 2: `n=7`. 
`7` is only divisible to `1` and itself, so we print `Prime` on a new line.
